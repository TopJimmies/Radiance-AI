# Radiance-AI
Radiance-AI is an experimental, organically growing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) project that leverages the Pinecone vector database for long-term relational self-referencing and utilizes OpenAI's NLP models in a sophisticated tiered agent structure for increased speed and reduced costs. The project's architecture is inspired by the Chunks and Rules Cognitive Agent Architecture found in W3C Cognitive Agent Architecture.

## Features
Pinecone vector database integration for efficient long-term memory storage and retrieval.
Advanced tiered agent structure that efficiently delegates tasks to OpenAI's NLP models based on length, difficulty, and complexity, resulting in faster processing and reduced operational costs.
Implements ideas from the Chunks and Rules Cognitive Agent Architecture to develop a more human-like understanding and reasoning capability.
Tiered Agent Structure
Radiance-AI's tiered agent structure is designed to maximize the efficiency of processing tasks while minimizing the costs associated with running large NLP models. The system intelligently delegates tasks to different models based on factors such as length, difficulty, and complexity. This approach enables Radiance-AI to achieve optimal performance while reducing the overall costs of running the program.

The tiered agent structure consists of the following components:

**Task Analyzer**: Analyzes incoming tasks and estimates their complexity, length, and difficulty.

**Model Selector**: Selects the appropriate NLP model from OpenAI's model suite (e.g., GPT-3, Codex) based on the analysis provided by the Task Analyzer.

**Task Executor**: Executes the task using the selected NLP model, retrieves the results, and returns them to the user or other components within the system.
By utilizing this tiered agent structure, Radiance-AI ensures that complex tasks are delegated to more powerful NLP models, while simpler tasks are handled by smaller, faster, and more cost-effective models.
